FAQs
~~~~

* **What types of games can Cheat Engine edit?**
   * Cheat Engine works with almost any game that does not use server sided values.
   * The variables have to be stored on your personal device to be edited.

* **Why did all the addresses disappear?**
   * This is most likely because the game stores variables as a different value type than the one the user sees.
   * While this often means you are out of luck you can try to get around this by changing the Value Types and retrying.

* **Can this get me Banned?**
   * Yes, Cheat Engine is considered hacking and can result in a ban if used in online games.
   * It is generally recommended to only use this for single-player games.

* **Can I get a ban if I have Cheat Engine on my computer while playing another game?**
   * No, other games have no way of knowing that you have Cheat Engine on your PC.
   * But if you have Cheat Engine running some games will ban you, even if you haven't opened the game in Cheat Engine.
